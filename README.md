# Live demo

The demo is published on [this page][demo-live-link].

This is a 30 minutes time rewrite of this [sketch.js demo][sketch-particles-demo-link] in JavaFx,
and recompiled to JavaScript with WebFx. Here is the JavaFx [source code][demo-source-link].

# Highlighted features

(in addition to those already explained in the [previous demo][previous-demo-repo-link])

## JavaFx canvas to HTML canvas mapping

In addition to the JavaFx scene graph mapping, WebFx also maps the JavaFx canvas API to the HTML canvas API, as illustrated by this demo.
